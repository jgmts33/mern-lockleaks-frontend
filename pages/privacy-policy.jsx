                <p><span class="purple-h3">In Short:</span> We do not currently respond to Do-Not-Track signals or similar mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Many web browsers and some mobile operating systems and applications offer a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature that allows you to express your preference not to be tracked online. However, there is currently no universally accepted standard for how DNT signals should be interpreted or implemented. Consequently, we do not currently respond to DNT signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your preference not to be tracked online.</p>

                <p>As technology and industry standards evolve, we remain committed to monitoring developments in this area and adjusting our practices accordingly. If a universally accepted standard for online tracking emerges that we are required to follow, we will update this privacy notice to inform you of any changes in our approach to DNT signals.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns about how your information is being tracked or used, please contact us using the details provided in this privacy notice.</p>
